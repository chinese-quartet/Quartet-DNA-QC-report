# Dnaseqc
Guideline for Quartet DNA and Methylation QC Pipeline

# Quartet DNA Quality Control Evaluation

This repository contains the quality control (QC) evaluation pipelines for DNA sequencing data and DNA methylation sequencing data generated by the Quartet project. Our aim is to assess and ensure the quality of the sequencing data through comprehensive QC processes. The project is divided into two main parts: the DNA Data QC Pipeline and the DNA Methylation Data QC Pipeline.

## Introduction

This project focuses on the quality control of DNA and DNA methylation sequencing data. Quality control is essential to validate the sequencing data for further analysis and research. Our pipelines leverage various software tools to analyze and generate QC reports, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the data.

## DNA Data QC Pipeline

The DNA Data QC Pipeline starts with VCF files, using hap.py and VBT software to analyze and transform the data format, followed by dnaseqc to generate quality control reports.

### Requirements

- hap.py
- VBT
- dnaseqc

### Usage

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze and transform data format with hap.py and VBT
<command to run hap.py>
<command to run VBT>

# Step 2: Generate QC report with dnaseqc
<command to run dnaseqc>
